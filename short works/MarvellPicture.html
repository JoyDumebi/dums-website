        Andrew Marvell (31 March 1621 — 16 August 1678) was an English metaphysical poet, satirist and politician. He is remembered for his style of writing and satirical and religious themes within his poetry, often attacking the church and defending the right of Parliament.

During the Commonwealth period, he was a close friend of John Milton, who helped him find employment in the Cromwell government. Some of Marvell’s most famous poems are “To His Coy Mistress”, “The Garden” and “An Horatian Ode”, as well as his political satires “Flecknoe” and “The Character of Holland”.
<h3>Andrew Marvell – Early Life and Education</h3><br>
Andrew Marvell was born in 1621 in Winestead-in-Holderness, East Riding of Yorkshire, near the city of Kingston upon Hull. He was born to Anne Pease Marvell and Andrew Marvell, who was a Church of England clergyman. The family moved to Hull in 1624 as Marvell’s father was appointed Lecturer at Holy Trinity Church there, and Marvell was educated at Hull Grammar School.

At the age of 13, Marvell attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he received a BA degree in 1639. His earliest surviving verses lead to no conclusions about his religion and politics as a student. He intended to stay on to study for an MA, but his father drowned in “the Tide of Humber” — the estuary at Hull made famous by “To his Coy Mistress” — in 1641, and he left shortly after.
<h3>Death</h3><br>
Marvell generally remained in London prior to his death, apart from two diplomatic journeys in the service of Charles Howard, Earl of Carlisle, in Holland (1662–1663) and in Russia, Sweden, and Denmark (1663–1665).

From 1669 until his death in 1678, Marvell was serving as London agent for the Hull Trinity House, a shipmasters’ guild. Just before his death, Marvell produced An Account of the Growth of Popery, and Arbitrary Government in England (1677), anonymously. It denounces the growing influence of both France and Catholicism at the English court, and by extension in the English government.

Marvell died suddenly in 1678, and his death is generally attributed to a fever. Because his health prior to this had been generally good, there was speculation that he was poisoned to death. At the time, there was a reward offered by the government for the identity of the author of one of his An Account of the Growth of Popery, though there was little doubt who the author was.

Marvell was buried in the church of St Giles in the Fields in central London.
