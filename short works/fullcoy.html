            </header>
            <p>
                Had we but World enough, and Time,<br>
This coyness, Lady, were no crime.<br>
We would sit down, and think which way<br>
To walk, and pass our long Loves Day.<br>
Thou by the Indian Ganges side<br>
Should'st Rubies find: I by the Tide<br>
Of Humber would complain. I would<br>
Love you ten years before the Flood:<br>
And you should if you please refuse<br>
Till the Conversion of the Jews.<br>
My vegetable Love should grow<br>
Vaster than Empires, and more slow.<br>
A hundred years should go to praise<br>
Thine Eyes, and on thy Forehead Gaze.<br>
Two hundred to adore each breast:<br>
But thirty thousand to the rest.<br>
An Age at least to every part,<br>
And the last Age should show your Heart.<br>
For Lady you deserve this State;<br>
Nor would I love at lower rate.<br>
    But at my back I always hear<br>
Time's wing√®d chariot hurrying near:<br>
And yonder all before us lye<br>
Desarts of vast Eternity.<br>
Thy Beauty shall no more be found,<br>
Nor, in thy marble Vault, shall sound<br>
My ecchoing Song: then Worms shall try<br>
That long preserv'd Virginity:<br>
And your quaint Honour turn to dust;<br>
And into ashes all my Lust.<br>
The Grave's a fine and private place,<br>
But none I think do there embrace.<br>
    Now therefore, while the youthful hew<br>
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,<br>
And while thy willing Soul transpires<br>
At every pore with instant Fires,<br>
Now let us sport us while we may;<br>
And now, like am'rous birds of prey,<br>
Rather at once our Time devour,<br>
Than languish in his slow-chapt pow'r.<br>
Let us roll all our Strength, and all<br>
Our sweetness, up into one Ball:<br>
And tear our Pleasures with rough strife,<br>
Thorough the Iron gates of Life.<br>
Thus, though we cannot make our Sun<br>
Stand still, yet we will make him run<br>
