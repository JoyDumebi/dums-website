                <p>
                    December was hot! I mean, all the weddings, parties, concerts, picnics, dinner dates,<br> 
                beach outings, tours and international trips to tourist sites? Babes and guys were looking<br>
                onfleek! Despite the whole fun, one thing stood out! This time, everyone was so<br> 
                concerned about <em>after enjoyment sapa of January</em>. Oh boy, people were concerned about <br>
                their expenses that a lot of tweets and memes were flying around. But trust the 21st century <br>
                ladies and badies, they took it upon themselves to slay on a budget! I mean, girls came out looking<br>
                like sharp <em>omotogbes</em> but they all weren't breaking the bank this time around. From hairstyles<br> 
                to outfits to footwears and accessories. Beautiful, stylish, yet reasonably priced. Way to go guys!<br>
                 Now, let's enjoy the fruits of our creativity and financial prudence this month. <em><strong>OMOTOGBE 1 OF THE 21st CENTURY</strong></em>,<br>
                  I salute you all!</p></article></section>
            <li><h3>2023, What to Expect</h3></li>
            <p>First, if you are Nigerian, living within Nigeria or in Diaspora, you know this is an extremely delicate<br>
            and deciding year for our us and our future generation. Don't act like you have lost the battle when it hasn't <br>
        even started. Quit saying that the elections would be rigged and get your PVC today. If you are in diaspora, you<br>
    aren't left out. You can sensitize your friends and families in Nigeria. Make sure that you go about this <em><strong>peacefully!</strong></em><br>
    We've been talking serious talks since. Let's change the tone! So, do not forget to slay queens and stay hydrated too,<em><strong>winks!</strong></em></p>
            <li><h3>Lifestyle, Latest Gist</h3></li>
            <p>Let's gist friends and baddies! Rumour has it that a certain someone got (manipulatively) their ex-fiancee to <br>
            give a public apology because she chose to call off their wedding. She previously did this because she heard<br>
        gossips that her fiance <em>likes Adam too</em>. As you already know, this is as much information as I can give. Plot<br>
        your graphs yourselves and find your answers!</p>
            <li><h3>January Trends</h3></li>
            <p>The pace and trend setters have done it <em><strong> again!!!</strong></em> They have put out all we need to look like<br>
                 this month all over the internet. And guess what?! we have soaked it all in and already living by the standards<br>
                of the trend setters. Check your make up! If they include nude lippies, lip pencils, glowing eyeliners, you are <br>
            definitely living up to their standards. Do you now wear ginger hair, i.e wigs, dreads, afro or whatnot? Then, you have<br>
        made a shift without even realising this.</p>
